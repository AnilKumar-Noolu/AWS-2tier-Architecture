# AWS-2tier-Architecture

A 2-tier architecture refers to a system design where there are two distinct layers or tiers: the presentation tier and the data tier. In the context of Terraform, this architecture can be implemented by provisioning infrastructure resources using Terraform modules.

Presentation Tier: This tier, also known as the front-end tier, handles the user interface and client interactions. It typically includes web servers, load balancers, and other components that serve and process user requests.

Data Tier: This tier, also known as the back-end tier, stores and manages the data required by the application. It usually consists of databases, data storage systems, and related infrastructure components.
